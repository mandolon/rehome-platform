# Rehome Platform - Database Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete database implementation for a collaborative project management platform designed specifically for architecture and construction teams. Built with Laravel 12.30.1 using SQLite for development.

## Database Schema

### Users Table
- **Purpose**: Multi-role user management for construction teams
- **Key Features**:
  - Role-based access: admin, project_manager, architect, engineer, contractor, client, viewer
  - Professional profiles with company, job title, contact information
  - Activity tracking with last login timestamps
  - Avatar support and biographical information

### Projects Table  
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive project management and tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Project categorization: residential, commercial, industrial, infrastructure, renovation
  - Status workflow: planning, design, construction, review, completed, on_hold
  - Budget tracking and timeline management
  - Team member assignment (JSON array of user IDs)
  - Client information and project notes
  - Unique project codes (e.g., "RH-2024-001")

### Tasks Table
- **Purpose**: Detailed task management with construction-specific workflows
- **Key Features**:
  - Priority levels: low, medium, high, urgent
  - Status tracking: pending, in_progress, review, completed, blocked  
  - Construction categories: design, engineering, construction, permits, inspection, etc.
  - Task dependencies (JSON array of task IDs)
  - Time tracking (estimated vs actual hours)
  - Completion percentage tracking

### File Attachments Table
- **Purpose**: Polymorphic file management for projects and tasks
- **Key Features**:
  - File type categorization: drawings, specifications, photos, CAD files, BIM models, etc.
  - Version control support
  - Metadata storage (JSON for dimensions, software used, etc.)
  - Public/private access control
  - File size tracking and MIME type validation

## Eloquent Models

### User Model
- Extends Laravel's Authenticatable for built-in authentication
- **Relationships**: 
  - `createdProjects()` - Projects created by user
  - `managedProjects()` - Projects managed by user  
  - `assignedTasks()` - Tasks assigned to user
  - `createdTasks()` - Tasks created by user
  - `fileAttachments()` - Files uploaded by user
- **Helper Methods**:
  - Role checking: `isAdmin()`, `isProjectManager()`, `canManageProjects()`
  - Display formatting: `getDisplayNameAttribute()`

### Project Model
- **Relationships**:
  - `creator()` - User who created project
  - `projectManager()` - Assigned project manager
  - `tasks()` - All project tasks
  - `fileAttachments()` - Project files (polymorphic)
  - Filtered task relationships: `activeTasks()`, `completedTasks()`, `overdueTasks()`
- **Business Logic**:
  - `getCompletionPercentageAttribute()` - Auto-calculated based on completed tasks
  - `isOverdue()` - Check if project is past due date
  - `teamMemberUsers()` - Get User models for team members
  - Status color coding for UI

### Task Model  
- **Relationships**:
  - `project()` - Parent project
  - `assignedUser()` - User assigned to task
  - `creator()` - User who created task
  - `fileAttachments()` - Task files (polymorphic)
  - `dependencyTasks()` - Tasks this depends on
  - `dependentTasks()` - Tasks that depend on this
- **Business Logic**:
  - `isOverdue()`, `isCompleted()` - Status checking
  - `markAsCompleted()` - Complete task workflow
  - Scope queries: `overdue()`, `highPriority()`, `assignedTo()`
  - UI helpers: priority/status color coding

### FileAttachment Model
- **Relationships**:
  - `attachable()` - Polymorphic relation to Project or Task
  - `uploader()` - User who uploaded file
- **File Management**:
  - File type detection: `isImage()`, `isDocument()`, `isCadFile()`
  - Size formatting: `getFormattedFileSizeAttribute()`
  - Icon class assignment for UI
  - Automatic file cleanup on model deletion
- **Scope Queries**: `public()`, `ofType()`, `images()`

## Sample Data

### Users (9 total)
- 1 Admin: Sarah Johnson (System Administrator)
- 1 Project Manager: Michael Chen (Skyline Construction)  
- 2 Architects: Emily Rodriguez (Modern Design Studio), Anna Wilson (Interior Designer)
- 1 Engineer: David Kumar (Structural Solutions Inc.)
- 2 Contractors: James Miller (Miller Construction), Robert Garcia (Site Supervisor)
- 1 Client: Lisa Thompson (Thompson Real Estate Group)
- 1 Viewer: Tom Anderson (Junior Project Coordinator)

### Projects (5 total)
1. **Sunset Ridge Residential Complex** - 50-unit residential, construction phase
2. **Downtown Office Tower** - 25-story commercial, design phase  
3. **Historic Library Renovation** - Heritage building, review phase
4. **Manufacturing Facility Expansion** - Industrial, on hold
5. **Greenwood Elementary School** - Infrastructure, completed

### Tasks (10 total)
- Realistic construction workflows: excavation, design review, inspections
- Various statuses and priorities
- Task dependencies (solar installation depends on electrical design)
- Time tracking data
- Construction-specific categories

### File Attachments (9 total)
- CAD drawings (.dwg files)
- Specifications (PDF documents)  
- Construction photos (ZIP archives)
- Reports and certificates
- Realistic file sizes and metadata

## Advanced Features

### Polymorphic Relationships
- FileAttachment model works with both Projects and Tasks
- Single table for all file attachments with proper type safety

### JSON Fields
- Project team members stored as JSON array of user IDs
- Task dependencies as JSON array of task IDs  
- File metadata as flexible JSON storage

### Business Logic
- Automatic completion percentage calculation
- Overdue detection with date comparison
- Role-based permission checking
- File type detection and categorization

### Database Optimization
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Foreign key constraints with proper cascade behavior
- Enum fields for status and category management
- Efficient polymorphic indexing

## Testing Results
- ✅ All migrations run successfully
- ✅ All model relationships work correctly
- ✅ Sample data loads completely
- ✅ Polymorphic relationships function properly
- ✅ Business logic methods return expected results
- ✅ Advanced features like task dependencies work
- ✅ File attachment system operational

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a construction project management platform with all the essential features needed for architecture and construction team collaboration.
