## Project Structure


## Windows: Run Storm Guard

Two quick ways to run our Storm Guard checks on Windows.

1) From repo root (uses Windows PowerShell, not pwsh):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Storm-Guard.ps1
```

2) Already inside a Windows PowerShell window? Run it directly:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\scripts\Storm-Guard.ps1
```

If execution is blocked:

```powershell
Unblock-File .\scripts\Storm-Guard.ps1
.\scripts\Storm-Guard.ps1
```

Notes:
- The dirty git tree warning is expected (storybook artifacts, etc.). The script will warn and continue for read-only proof runs.
- In VS Code, the Tasks "Storm: Proof (Read-Only)" and "Storm: Enable Writes (One-Run)" now use Windows PowerShell under the hood.
- If you really want PowerShell 7 later:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell -e
```
