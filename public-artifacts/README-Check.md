# README Cleanup Check

**Date/Time:** 2025-09-26

**Actions Taken:**
- Renamed `frontend/README.md` â†’ `frontend/FRONTEND.md` (content is still useful for frontend devs)
- Removed `frontend/README.md` (after rename)
- Removed `backend/README.md` (default Laravel boilerplate, not needed)

**Post-fix Verification:**

List of `*README.md` files after cleanup (excluding vendor/backup):

- `README.md` (root)

List of other relevant docs:
- `frontend/FRONTEND.md`

All other `README.md` files are in backup or vendor folders and are not part of the main project documentation.
